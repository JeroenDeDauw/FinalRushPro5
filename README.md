# Final Rush Pro 5
<img align="right" src="preview.jpg">
A survival map for [Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance Forever][FAF].

## New in version 5

This is an alpha version, no stable release is available yet.

(Changes since version 4.0007)

* Made the Auto Reclaim option work with recent versions of FAF
* Added Spawn Delay option
* Fixed the MML restriction option
* Fixed the T3 Mobile Arty restriction option
* Fixed the Sniper Bot restriction option
* Added additional possible values to the Auto Reclaim option
* Added additional possible values to the Tech Level Delay option
* Dropped Final Rush UI and dependence on the FinalRushPro3 mod
* Improved the wording of all option titles and descriptions

## Installation

* Download the [latest version of the map][download]
* Extract the zip and rename the directory from `FinalRushPro5-master` to `Final Rush Pro 5`
* Place the directory into `Documents\My Games\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander Forged Alliance\Maps`

Note: you do not need to have the FinalRushPro3 mod like you did with version 4 of this map.
Furthermore since the Auto Reclaim option has been fixed, you probably want to use that instead
of the Vampire mod.

## Updates and contributing

You can find the latest version of the map on the [Final Rush Pro 5 GitHub project][GitHub], which is
also the place where you can file issues, post feature request, and submit patches.
